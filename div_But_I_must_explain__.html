No one rejects, <i>dislikes</i>, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who&nbsp;<b>loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but</b>&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;<b>circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great</b>&nbsp;pleasure.&nbsp;<b>To take a trivial example, which of us ever</b>&nbsp;undertakes&nbsp;<b>laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who</b>&nbsp;has any right to&nbsp;<b>find fault</b>&nbsp;with a man who&nbsp;<b>chooses to enjoy a pleasure</b>&nbsp;that has no annoying consequences, or&nbsp;<b>one</b>&nbsp;who&nbsp;<b>avoids a pain</b>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<b>produces no</b>&nbsp;resultant pleasure?<br></div>
